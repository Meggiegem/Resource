Homework: Variable Type vs Object Type
1. Which of the followings is considered boxing?  C
a. double dblx = fx;
b. float fx = ix;
c. object myobjx = fx;
d. int ix = objy;

2. Which of the followings is considered unboxing?  D
a. string str = ix.ToString();
b. double dblx =(double) fx;
c. object myobjx = fx;
d. int ix = (int) objy
;
3. Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.  
float fx = (double) (float) objdblx;

4. Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object o another variable of type double.
double dx = (double) objflx;

5. Convert the string strx to a double dblx:
double dblx = (double) strx

6. Convert the integer ix to a float fx:
float fx = ix

7. Convert the double dblx to a string strx:
string strx =(string) dblx

8. Object is the base  class of all other data types.

9. What is an object (the definition)?
	An object models real world objects and contain data and actions.  It is a block of memory that has been allocated.  Objects are also instances that can be stored in either a variable, an array or a collection

10. How do you declare an object in C#?  Example:  Student newStudent = new Student()
What is the difference between an object and a variable?

	A variable is a named area of memory - a container of information and its value can change. Variables have a name, a type and a value.
	An Oject is a block of memory that has been allocated.
